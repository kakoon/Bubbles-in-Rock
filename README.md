Solution Description 

  The goal of the team was to distinguish bubbles in each element's image and show the bubbles in different colors for the elements in 2d, further in 3d image. 3d image could be made with combining all the layers of the rock images but we didn't go that far. We've found the boundaries of bubbles on each element image (taken with spectrum images) and showed them with different colors.
